# security_system

In this project I have created security system using C++ language, in which there will be various options like registration, login, change password, etc. I have used different concepts of C++ programming language, like switch case statements, loops, arrays, file handling operations, etc., to create this Security System Project in C++. In this C++ Project, you can register, login, and then, if you wish to change the password, you can also do that by clicking on the change password option.
